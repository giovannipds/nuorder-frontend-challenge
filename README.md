# NuORDER Front-end Challenge

## Goal

We would like to have an opportunity to learn about your skills. This is an open ended project where you should put as much effort as you consider right to show what you think is important.

## Delivery of Code

Please share a Github repo with your code.

## Task

Using [Github’s API](https://developer.github.com/), build an application with an autocomplete input box for searching issues for [React’s repo](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues). Input and results should be able to navigate via keyboard shortcuts. Each result should have but not limited to, the issue’s title and labels.

## Result

**Demo:** https://giovannipds.github.io/nuorder-frontend-challenge/

Project bootstrapped with Create React App, more information about it [here](REACT.md).

### Testing locally

You may want to create a token to have more than 10 requests/minute: generate it at [Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and create your `.env` file based at [.env.example](.env.example).
